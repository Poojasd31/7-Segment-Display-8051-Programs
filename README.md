8051 Seven Segment Display Interfacing

A 7-segment display is an electronic display device used to show decimal numbers (0‚Äì9) and some alphabets.
With the 8051 microcontroller, we can drive the display by sending appropriate bit patterns.

There are two main types:

Common Cathode (CC) ‚Üí All cathodes tied to GND, segments glow with logic HIGH.

Common Anode (CA) ‚Üí All anodes tied to VCC, segments glow with logic LOW.
